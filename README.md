The Rover project aims to prototype a survey configuration in REDCap to assess its feasibility as a global intake system for Stanford Medicine. The scope includes two phases:
1. Architect a new REDCap workflow for parent and child projects.
2. Develop a Universal Dashboard via an external module, represented by this repository.
